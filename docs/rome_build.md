## rome build

Build SugarCRM

### Synopsis


This will take a source version of Sugar and substitute out all the necessary build tags and create an
installable copy of Sugar for you to use and dev on.

By default this will ignore sugarcrm/node_modules, but build sugarcrm/sidecar/node_modules to save on time since the
node_modules are not required inside of SugarCRM but are for Sidecar.
